Hey, this is for directory for your services. Here you'll have business logic implemented. It's business logic layer

This is to keep routes clean
Routes should only do HTTP thing: parse request, return response
Everything else - logic, calculation, DB work - belongs here

We separate business logic from the web logic
It's good for usability, good for testability
